 - Explain how all objects are defined/created, as well as pathfinding algorithm
 - Describe how optimization problem was setup and integrates with robots
 
Results:
 1. Base case
 2. Increased obstacles
 3. Increased steepness
 4. Increased N
 5. Bad case: everything increased

Writing:
 - Results and explanation for each case
 - Conclusion
 - Appendix (code examples, documentation)
